Greetings, Mari. 
We have encountered an anomaly.

#SAY.W2.523.AI
I would like you to assess the anomaly, and then, at your convenience, please check the life support and ship systems and update the logs.

There was a slight malfunction in the navigational systems that was causing us to begin to deviate from our course.

#SAY.W2.665.
The problem appears to have been caused by a slight miscalculation in the impact of passing relatively near to large masses on our trajectory. After re-examining our calcuations, I believe I have addressed the problem.

#SAY.W2.666.
I have also performed all of the routine maintenance checks; all systems check out. Nothing else to report at this time.

#SAY.W2.647.
I suppose most relationships developed under those circumstances wouldn't last in the long run. I mean, we both thought, literally, that we were the last ones left.

#SAY.W2.650.
When it all started, everything was chaos. I don't know how I made it to the shelter. I don't know why the rest of my family didn't, but there she was and we were the only ones there.

#SAY.W2.651.
It's a wonder we didn't kill each other, those years alone together in the shelter. We got really good at entertaining ourselves, and each other.

#SAY.W2.652.
We talked about suicide, from time to time. We both agreed that if we were gonna do it, we'd go together. One of many promises that we didn't keep, I guess.

I imagine we'd have gone through with it eventually, if we hadn't been found within a few years, hadn't connected with what was left of humanity at that point.

There was a slight malfunction in the navigational systems that was causing us to begin to deviate from our course.

#SAY.W3.665.
The problem appears to have been caused by a slight miscalculation in the impact of passing relatively near to large masses on our trajectory. After re-examining our calcuations, I believe I have addressed the problem.

#SAY.W3.666.
I have also performed all of the routine maintenance checks; all systems check out. Nothing else to report at this time.

Those days in the shelter were such a strange mix of feelings. We didn't think we'd ever be able to leave. We hoped we weren't the only ones left but we had no way of knowing.

#SAY.W3.644.
The days really blended into one another. We had plenty to entertain ourselves, thanks to Lili's uncle, who had prepared the shelter. He had set up an extensive media archive; I think pretty much everything he could get his hands on was in it.

#SAY.W3.645.
At first we had tried to keep track of time and keep to some sort of schedule. We watched things as if they were still being released on a weekly basis. But eventually we gave up on that.

#SAY.W3.646.
We snuggled, we fought, we fucked, we watched, we listened, we read, we exercised, we slept, we ate. We fought boredom every way we could.

It turned out we weren't the only survivors and there was a larger group nearby, mostly professors from the university. Once things settled down they started looking for others & gathering everyone together.

#SAY.W3.633.
They had a large underground compound and a means for growing food. Not enough to sustain everyone forever but enough to keep things going for decades at least.

#SAY.W3.634.
Preparation for this mission was already underway.

#SAY.W3.635.
For some reason, as soon as we joined them, Lili and I started to drift apart. She started avoiding me as much as possible. Eventually I confronted her to find out why.

#SAY.W3.913.
She gave me a bunch of bullshit reasons and it hurt a lot. I'm still not sure what happened but I guess she just didn't feel the same way about me that I did about her.

#SAY.W3.914.
For her, our relationship was just another form of entertainment, a way to keep herself from being completely miserable while stuck in the shelter with me.

There was a slight malfunction in the navigational systems that was causing us to begin to deviate from our course.

#SAY.W4.665.
The problem appears to have been caused by a slight miscalculation in the impact of passing relatively near to large masses on our trajectory. After re-examining our calcuations, I believe I have addressed the problem.

#SAY.W4.666.
I have also performed all of the routine maintenance checks; all systems check out. Nothing else to report at this time.

But it's not like there was anything keeping me there, not any more. Not with Lili gone.

#SAY.W4.646.
I guess she's {i}really{/i} gone now, not just out of my life. It all seems so unreal now.

#SAY.W4.647.
I suppose most relationships developed under those circumstances wouldn't last in the long run. I mean, we both thought, literally, that we were the last ones left.

#SAY.W4.650.
When it all started, everything was chaos. I don't know how I made it to the shelter. I don't know why the rest of my family didn't, but there she was and we were the only ones there.

#SAY.W4.651.
It's a wonder we didn't kill each other, those years alone together in the shelter. We got really good at entertaining ourselves, and each other.

#SAY.W4.652.
We talked about suicide, from time to time. We both agreed that if we were gonna do it, we'd go together. One of many promises that we didn't keep, I guess.

#SAY.W4.653.
I imagine we'd have gone through with it eventually, if we hadn't been found within a few years, hadn't connected with what was left of humanity at that point.
