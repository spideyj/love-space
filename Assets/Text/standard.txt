There was a slight malfunction in the navigational systems that was causing us to begin to deviate from our course.

#SAY.Waking2.665.
The problem appears to have been caused by a slight miscalculation in the impact of passing relatively near to large masses on our trajectory. After re-examining our calcuations, I believe I have addressed the problem.

But it's not like there was anything keeping me there, not any more. Not with Lili gone.

#SAY.Waking2.646.
I guess she's {i}really{/i} gone now, not just out of my life. It all seems so unreal now.

#SAY.Waking2.647.
I suppose most relationships developed under those circumstances wouldn't last in the long run. I mean, we both thought, literally, that we were the last ones left.

#SAY.Waking2.650.
When it all started, everything was chaos. I don't know how I made it to the shelter. I don't know why the rest of my family didn't, but there she was and we were the only ones there.

#SAY.Waking2.651.
It's a wonder we didn't kill each other, those years alone together in the shelter. We got really good at entertaining ourselves, and each other.

#SAY.Waking2.652.
We talked about suicide, from time to time. We both agreed that if we were gonna do it, we'd go together. One of many promises that we didn't keep, I guess.

#SAY.Waking2.653.
I imagine we'd have gone through with it eventually, if we hadn't been found within a few years, hadn't connected with what was left of humanity at that point.

There was a slight malfunction in the navigational systems that was causing us to begin to deviate from our course.

#SAY.Waking1.298.
The problem appears to have been caused by a slight miscalculation in the impact of passing relatively near to large masses on our trajectory. After re-examining our calcuations, I believe I have addressed the problem.

#SAY.Waking1.299.
I have also performed all of the routine maintenance checks; all systems check out. Nothing else to report at this time.
