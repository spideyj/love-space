There was a slight malfunction in the navigational systems that was causing us to begin to deviate from our course.

#SAY.Waking1.298.
The problem appears to have been caused by a slight miscalculation in the impact of passing relatively near to large masses on our trajectory. After re-examining our calcuations, I believe I have addressed the problem.

#SAY.Waking1.299.
I have also performed all of the routine maintenance checks; all systems check out. Nothing else to report at this time.

We have encountered an anomaly. I would like you to assess the anomaly, and then, at your convenience, please check the life support and ship systems and update the logs.
